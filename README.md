#Unsplash for Android
Unsplash for Android is a free open source android client for the awesome [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com) service by [Crew](https://pickcrew.com/)

There are already over 600 high resolution images included, and there are 10 new photos daily.
(You can visit https://unsplash.com to download the originals and use them in your commercial projects too)

This application was designed with the new Material Design principles in mind. It gives you a perfectly fluid user flow with simple and fresh animations. It also unleashes the full power of Android Lollipop by providing bright colors fetched out of each single wallpaper.
